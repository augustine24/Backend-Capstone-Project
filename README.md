# Backend-Capstone-Project
An assignment done on coursera, my capstone project. It's grading criteria was for it to meet the following conditions:

Does the web application use Django to serve static HTML content?

Does the application connect the backend to a MySQL database?

Are the menu and table booking APIs implemented?

Is the application set up with user registration and authentication?

Does the application contain unit tests?

Can the API be tested with the Insomnia REST client?
